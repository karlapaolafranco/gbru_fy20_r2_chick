#This data is from chick1 and chick2 DNA sequencing.

#the csv file named: Chick1_Chick2_Sumcounts_taxa.csv, has the raw data that I copied and pasted to merge using pandas dataframe
#there are two python notebooks. (1) Was used to apply multiplicative replacement and centered-log ratio. (2) was used to generate dot plot

#there is a second csv file that resulted from applyin multiplicative replacement and centered-log ratio; this csv file is used with notebook (2) to plot the data

#dot plot link below:
#https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/pairgrid_dotplot.html

#do you think the dot plot data looks okay?
