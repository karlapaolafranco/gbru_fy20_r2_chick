#This data is from chick1 and chick2 DNA sequencing.

#the csv file named: Chick1_Chick2_Sumcounts_taxa.csv, has the raw data that I copied and pasted to merge using pandas dataframe. The output of merging resulted in chick1&chick2_merged.csv

#there are two python notebooks. (1) Was used to apply multiplicative replacement and centered-log ratio. (2) was used to generate dot plot

#Adam, I need help adding horizontal lines to stripplot. This should help visualize the data per taxa
